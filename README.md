# LAZYFRONT

Have you ever found yourself in a situation such as you're trying to learn a new backend framework but find yourself losing time building pages, styling them and adding interactivity ? Yes ? Then this codebase is exactly what you need. 

We provide you with a mini social media application template to get you started. Just clone this repo, download it, fork it, ... and start directly building that backend CRUD code.  

# HOW TO USE

All you need to do, it's head over to the **public/scripts/api.js** file and use the functions inside of there and start connecting the template to your backend api.

But, keep in mind that everything is fully customizable.
